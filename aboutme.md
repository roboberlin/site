I'm an assistant professor in the department of Physics and Astronomy at [Oberlin College](http://home.oberlin.edu). Before that I was a postdoctoral Research Associate in computational relativity at [Cornell](http://astro.cornell.edu). Before that I completed my PhD work in the [Theoretical Astrophysics](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu) group at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu). Before that, I studied undergraduate physics at the [University of Utah](http://physics.utah.edu). Before that, is less interesting. 

My central research focus is *vacuum General Relativity*, that is, the dynamics of empty space. Since grad school, I've been a member of the [Simulating Extreme Spacetimes](http://black-holes.org) collaboration, which develops and uses a numerical relativity code, [SpEC](http://www.black-holes.org/SpEC.html), to simulate collisions of black holes, and to calculate the gravitational waves that they produce. Such gravitational waves are now being measured by the [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu) observatory.
